## Mission

Help people reduce unnecessary daily spending by making costs visible
*in the moment*, without guilt, shame, or complexity.

The app exists to support better everyday decisions, not to enforce
long-term financial planning.

---

## Core Philosophy

- Focus on **today**, not months or years
- Encourage awareness, not punishment
- Small daily choices matter more than perfect tracking
- The app should feel supportive, not judgmental

---

## What This App Is

- A **daily budgeting tool**
- A **habit-awareness aid**
- A **lightweight, low-friction companion** used multiple times per day
- A **local-first application** that respects user privacy

---

## What This App Is Not

- A full personal finance system
- An accounting or bookkeeping tool
- A forecasting or investment platform
- A social or competitive app
- A productivity or gamification system

---

## User Mindset

The typical user:
- Wants to curb spending on non-essential items (e.g. drinks, snacks)
- Does not want to micromanage finances
- Prefers quick interactions over detailed analysis
- May open the app impulsively, on the go, or late in the day

The app should meet the user where they are, not demand discipline.

---

## Time Horizon

- The primary unit of time is **one day**
- Yesterday and tomorrow are secondary
- The app should reinforce the idea of a “fresh start” each day

---

## Emotional Tone

- Calm
- Neutral
- Encouraging
- Matter-of-fact

Avoid:
- Shame
- Alarmist language
- Overly financial or corporate tone

---

## Privacy & Trust

- User data belongs to the user
- Local storage is the default
- Nothing is shared or uploaded without explicit intent
- The app should feel safe to use casually and privately

---

## Product Success Criteria

The app is successful if:
- Users open it daily
- Users feel more aware of their spending
- Users reduce impulse purchases over time
- The app remains simple as features are added

---

## Design Biases

When trade-offs arise, prefer:
- Simplicity over power
- Clarity over cleverness
- Speed over completeness
- Local behavior over remote dependencies
